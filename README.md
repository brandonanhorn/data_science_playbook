# A complete data science playbook

This playbook will have Python code for:
functions, matplotlib, seaborn, altair, pandas, bayesian statistics, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, decion trees, catboost, clustering, deep learning, nlp, webscraping, automation.. and much much more!

## Where to start?
1) Learn the basics of Python
2) PANDAS - best source for data mining/exploration
3) Visualization - (Matplotlib, Seaborn, LOTS of other ones to learn - start with those two)



Data Science steps:
1. Define the problem.
2. Gather the data.
3. Explore the data.
4. Model the data.
5. Evaluate the model.
6. Answer the problem.
