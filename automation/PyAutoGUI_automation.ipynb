    "# Controlling the Keyboard and Mouse with GUI Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing various Python modules for editing spreadsheets, downloading files, and launching programs is useful, but sometimes there just aren’t any  modules for the applications you need to work with. The ultimate tools  for automating tasks on your computer are programs you write that  directly control the keyboard and mouse. These programs can control  other applications by sending them virtual keystrokes and mouse clicks,  justpython3- as if you were sitting at your computer and interacting  with the applications yourself. This technique is known as *graphical user interface automation*, or *GUI automation* for short. With GUI automation, your programs can do anything that a  human user sitting at the computer can do, except spill coffee on the  keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of GUI automation as programming a robotic  arm. You can program the robotic arm to type at your keyboard and move  your mouse for you. This technique is particularly useful for tasks that involve a lot of mindless clicking or filling out of forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pyautogui` module has functions for simulating mouse movements, button clicks, and scrolling the mouse wheel. This chapter covers only a subset of  PyAutoGUI’s features; you can find the full documentation at *http://pyautogui.readthedocs.org/*."

    "\n",
    "Before you jump in to a GUI automation, you should  know how to escape problems that may arise. Python can move your mouse  and type keystrokes at an incredible speed. In fact, it might be too  fast for other programs to keep up with. Also, if something goes wrong  but your program keeps moving the mouse around, it will be hard to tell  what exactly the program is doing or how to recover from the problem.  Like the enchanted brooms from Disney’s *The Sorcerer’s Apprentice*, which kept filling—and then overfilling—Mickey’s tub with water, your  program could get out of control even though it’s following your  instructions perfectly. Stopping the program can be difficult if the  mouse is moving around on its own, preventing you from clicking the IDLE window to close it. Fortunately, there are several ways to prevent or  recover from GUI automation problems.\n",

    "## Shutting Down Everything by Logging Out\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the simplest way to stop an out-of-control  GUI automation program is to log out, which will shut down all running  programs. On Windows and Linux, the logout hotkey is CTRL-ALT-DEL. On OS X, it is CMD-SHIFT-OPTION-Q. By logging out, you’ll lose any unsaved work, but at least you won’t have to wait for a full reboot of the computer."

To do this, set the `pyautogui.PAUSE` variable to the number of seconds you want it to pause. For example, after setting `pyautogui.PAUSE = 1.5`, every PyAutoGUI function call will wait one and a half seconds after  performing its action. Non-PyAutoGUI instructions will not have this  pause.\n",

Either way, the  fail-safe feature will stop the program if you quickly move the mouse as far up and left as you can. You can disable this feature by setting `pyautogui.FAILSAFE = False`.
