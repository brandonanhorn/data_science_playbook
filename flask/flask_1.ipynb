    "Flask is a fast, lightweight way to connect your Python scripts to a server. It's a simple and robust framework that can do small tasks (create a microblog, stand up a simple API) or complex ones (Pinterest's API, create a twitter clone).\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is called a _microframework_ because it is minimalistic and does not impose an application structure on you. Flask allows you to \"plug in\" libraries of your choice to add additional functionality. \"Heavier\" frameworks such as Django typically come with their own libraries (e.g. for database access). This is often convenient, but it takes more time to learn and is not as flexible.\n",

Sending parameters in the body allows you to send more data than would fit inside the URL.
